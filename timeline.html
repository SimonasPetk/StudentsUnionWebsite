               <p>Usual Monday might be different for every student but here is how my Monday starts and goes. 
                  Usually, I wake up at 7 am perform my morning routine till 9 am and then go to the students' union to read some material for the classes and on 10 am when <a href = "https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/proper-pasty">Proper Pasty Company</a> opens I have some handmade steak pasty for breakfast. After, the breakfast I go to study in some quiet place. Sadly, it is mostly not in the SU. After the lectures somewhere about 7 pm a meet up with my friend to have a drink and play some pool in <a href = "https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/bar-one">Bar One</a>.

               </div>
               <p>I try to wake up consistently so on Tuesday I wake up the same time as on Monday do the same thing till 9 am and go to lectures on the Diamond. After the lectures, I go to get quick and easy lunch in <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/the-view-deli">The View Deli</a>. While having my lunch I have a quick glance at the lecture slides of Web & Internet Technology if they are up and at 3 pm go to that module's lecture. Later, I have a quick lunch at home and go to study at the Student's Union together with my friends. Because we all know that we are not going to study in our room. ;)

               <p>On Wednesday the lectures start at 9 am so there is no time to visit SU in the morning. However, after the lectures, there is a great place to get some coffee and have a small talk with your friends. So, on a typical Wednesday after the lectures, I go to the <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/coffee-revolution">Coffee Revolution</a> whenever I am alone or with friends to get an amazing cup of Americano and a waffle. It brightens up your day instantly if it was rough. By the way, if there is a good weather in the SU there is a nice place to just sit and chill outside.

               <p>On Thursday lectures start again from early morning so I go to the SU to eat lunch in the <a href= "https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/new-leaf">New Leaf</a> where you can get a fresh, fast and most importantly healthy meal. At 3 pm it is time to go to the Web & Internet Technology module lecture and learn some more Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Maybe, I will become a web developer someday? Well, we'll know that in three years. Because I really like playing pool, I usually go to play more of it on Thursday together with my course mates in Bar One. </p>
